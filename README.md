Using data analysis, data modeling, DAX calculations, and Power BI visualizations, the project aimed to uncover revenue trends, highlight top-performing brands and regions, and generate actionable recommendations to optimize sales and operational strategies.

## Project Overview
The objectives of the project were to:
1. Clean and prepare raw sales, vendor, brand, and region data.
2. Model relationships between multiple datasets to enable effective analysis.
3. Use DAX to calculate key business metrics such as total revenue, average purchase price, and vendor contribution percentages.

a. Top-performing brands by revenue
b. Regional revenue breakdown
c. Time series analysis of revenue trends
d. Store performance comparisons
5. Provide strategic recommendations to enhance sales growth, customer targeting, and operational decision-making.

The project specifically addressed the challenges identified by management, including missing values, poorly formatted data, lack of actionable insights, and unclear sales performance metrics.

2. Vendor Data: Information about suppliers and vendors.
3. Brand Data: Product brand details including size and descriptions.
4. Region Data: City and regional store locations.
5. Calendar Data: Date information to enable time series analysis.

The data required significant cleaning and restructuring, including:

## Recommendations included:
1. Collecting additional customer demographic data to better tailor marketing efforts.
